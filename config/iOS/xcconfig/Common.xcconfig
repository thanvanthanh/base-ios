// Bump versions here reflected to all targets and extensions by one way.
//

// IMPORTANT NOTES :
//
// -    If app version and/or build version doesn't change after an update here,
//      clean the build folder (Alt key+ Product Clean Tab) and Clean Product
//
// -    To deploy as `Beta` or `Release` **if some failure**, change build and archive scheme to matching environment
//      Very important, **IF FAILURE** we need to update CloudKit Container by select only one devoted matching
//      iCloud bundle container to `Capabilities` tab, actually a `$(AS_CLOUD_CONTAINER_BUNDLE_ID)` Key is setted to manage
//      automatically entitlements for iCloud Container, (in this case check entitlement value for matching container identifier).
//
// -    Be sure App IDs, App Groups IDs, iCloud Containers (bundle identifiers and container deployed to production)
//      and Provisioning Profiles are ready to use before
//      any release/beta deployment.
//
// -    Verify before archiving that `Always Embed Swift..` as `ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES` Key
//      is setted to `NO` for Apex extensions (Pushs extensions, widget extension) only.
//
// -    To be sure deployment to release/beta works well, check if `Product Bundle identifier` as `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` Key
//      is setted to `$(AS_APP_BUNDLE_ID)`, this will fix bug with provisioning profiles for push extensions apex.
//
// -    If some problems persists, refresh provisioning profiles, team profile, re-start XCode or re-start computer. We can also
//      check provisioning matching by compare in upload app to store from automatic certificates xcode management to manually
//      certificates management.

/// App and appex version number
